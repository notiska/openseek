# OpenSeek

A library to interface with the [Seek Thermal Compact](https://www.thermal.com/compact-series.html) line of cameras.  

## Reasoning
Although Seek are allowing smaller developers to access their SDK, it is still not "public" per-se, and certainly not open source.  
This project therefore aims to provide an open source alternative to their SDK, which can be hacked and integrated more freely.

## Legal
No confidential information (AKA the SDK) was used in the making of this library.  
The code from this library was created through means of already public information.
