# OpenSeek

**WIP** - I am still working on reverse engineering the camera, the library is not functional.

A library to interface with the [Seek Thermal Compact](https://www.thermal.com/compact-series.html) line of cameras.  

## Reasoning
1. Making an hackable and freely integratable alternative to the SDK.
2. "The whole nine yards" - although there are other open source projects that exist, I haven't seen many (if any) that really unlock all the functionality of the device.
