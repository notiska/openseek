# OpenSeek

A library to interface with the [Seek Thermal Compact](https://www.thermal.com/compact-series.html) line of cameras.  

## Reasoning
1. Making an hackable and freely integratable alternative to the SDK.
2. "The whole nine yards" - although there are other open source projects that exist, I haven't seen many (if any) that really unlock all the functionality of the device.

## Legal
No confidential information (AKA the SDK) was used in the making of this library.  
The code from this library was created through means of already public information.
